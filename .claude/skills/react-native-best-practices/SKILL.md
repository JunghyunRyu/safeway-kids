# React Native Best Practices

## Overview

Performance optimization guide for React Native applications, covering JavaScript/React, Native (iOS/Android), and bundling optimizations. Based on Callstack's "Ultimate Guide to React Native Optimization".

## Skill Format

Each reference file follows a hybrid format for fast lookup and deep understanding:

- **Quick Pattern**: Incorrect/Correct code snippets for immediate pattern matching
- **Quick Command**: Shell commands for process/measurement skills
- **Quick Config**: Configuration snippets for setup-focused skills
- **Quick Reference**: Summary tables for conceptual skills
- **Deep Dive**: Full context with When to Use, Prerequisites, Step-by-Step, Common Pitfalls

**Impact ratings**: CRITICAL (fix immediately), HIGH (significant improvement), MEDIUM (worthwhile optimization)

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Debugging slow/janky UI or animations
- Investigating memory leaks (JS or native)
- Optimizing app startup time (TTI)
- Reducing bundle or app size
- Writing native modules (Turbo Modules)
- Profiling React Native performance
- Reviewing React Native code for performance

## Priority-Ordered Guidelines

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | FPS & Re-renders | CRITICAL | `js-*` |
| 2 | Bundle Size | CRITICAL | `bundle-*` |
| 3 | TTI Optimization | HIGH | `native-*`, `bundle-*` |
| 4 | Native Performance | HIGH | `native-*` |
| 5 | Memory Management | MEDIUM-HIGH | `js-*`, `native-*` |
| 6 | Animations | MEDIUM | `js-*` |

## Quick Reference

### Optimization Workflow

Follow this cycle for any performance issue: **Measure → Optimize → Re-measure → Validate**

### Critical: FPS & Re-renders

- Replace ScrollView with FlatList/FlashList for lists
- Use React Compiler for automatic memoization
- Use atomic state (Jotai/Zustand) to reduce re-renders
- Use `useDeferredValue` for expensive computations

### Critical: Bundle Size

- Avoid barrel imports (import directly from source)
- Remove unnecessary Intl polyfills only after checking Hermes API
- Enable tree shaking (Expo SDK 52+ or Re.Pack)
- Enable R8 for Android native code shrinking

### High: TTI Optimization

- Disable JS bundle compression on Android (enables Hermes mmap)
- Use native navigation (react-native-screens)
- Preload commonly-used expensive screens

### High: Native Performance

- Use background threads for heavy native work
- Prefer async over sync Turbo Module methods
- Use C++ for cross-platform performance-critical code

## Problem → Skill Mapping

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| App feels slow/janky | Measure FPS → Profile React |
| Too many re-renders | Profile React → React Compiler |
| Slow startup (TTI) | Measure TTI → Analyze JS bundle |
| Large app size | Analyze app → R8 Android |
| Memory growing | JS memory leaks or Native memory leaks |
| Animation drops frames | Reanimated worklets |
| List scroll jank | FlatList/FlashList |
| TextInput lag | Uncontrolled components |
